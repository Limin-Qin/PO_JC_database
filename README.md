Periodic orbits in Jupiter-Collisto system
The .mat file is the data for the periodic orbit families named by their names. It contains: the root point, the family name, orbit state parameters, 
time period, Jacobian constant, alpha, beta and the stability indices S. It is noted that the stability indices is S rather than V. 
This has no effect on drawing orbits or Broucke stability diagram and finding bifurcations. And for some families the stability indices S only preserve the real part. 
Please check or recompute stability indices if the readers need to use these parameters.

Some families are departed into two .mat file such as W4_1P4 and W4_1P4_2.

The .txt file contains the black line families in bifurcation diagram in the paper. It has the orbit families name, orbit state parameters and time period.
one orbit is supplied for each families.
